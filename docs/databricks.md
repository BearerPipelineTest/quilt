# Running Quilt in Databricks

## Install `quilt3` on Your Cluster
Before using `quilt3` in your Databricks notebooks, you'll need to install it on your cluster. Find your cluster from the __Compute__ tab. From your Cluster overview, click on the __Libraries__ tab, then click the "Install new" button. Select PyPI under Library Source and enter `quilt3` for the Package.
